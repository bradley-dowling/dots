This is a programming assignment that explores Swing and JFrames.
Dots.java is a program that opens a window and allows 2 users
to play a game of "dots and boxes". The components of the window
are here within Dots.java, while the extension of a JPanel that
the users click within is in MyPanel.java. The code that controls
the behavior of the individual boxes is housed within Box.java.
